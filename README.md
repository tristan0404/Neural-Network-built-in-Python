# Neural Network built in Python
A 3-layer network for binary classification, built in python using NumPy math

## Network Architecture

- Input layer: 2 nodes (Height, Weight)
- Hidden layer 1: 3 nodes
- Hidden layer 2: 3 nodes
- Output layer: 1 node (binary classification: 1 = High risk of health complecations and 0 = Low risk)
